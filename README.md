## ✨ Features

- ⚡ Instantly puts you into a solo public session
- 🧠 Automates the suspend/resume trick (no more opening Task Manager!)
- 🪶 Ultra lightweight executable (~500KB)
- 💻 No installation or setup – just run and play
- 🔒 100% safe: doesn’t modify game files or use external cheats

## 🛠️ How It Works

The tool suspends the `GTA5.exe` process for 10 seconds, causing other players to time out. Then it automatically resumes the process — leaving you alone in a public lobby.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Launch GTA Online and join a public lobby  
2. Run `stayalone.exe`  
3. Wait a few seconds... boom. You're alone 😎

> Optional: Pin it to your taskbar for quick access
